## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive guide for the performance of Nairobi airquality. We use p2.5 means of measure where we know that: 
The PM2.5 readings should ideally be kept below 12 µg/m³ for good air quality, with concentrations between 12-35 µg/m³ considered moderate, 36-55 µg/m³ unhealthy for sensitive groups, and levels exceeding 55 µg/m³ posing risks to the general population's health.

In this guide, we cover the following topics:

- **Getting Started**: Setting up your Python environment and installing necessary libraries.
- **Data Preparation**: Loading, and preprocessing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Techniques for understanding data, including summary statistics, data visualization, and data distribution analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative visualizations to convey findings effectively.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using this command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-eda-visualization.git

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed. Use a virtual environment if desired. Install the required libraries with `pip`:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Start a Jupyter Notebook server to access the code and run the provided examples:

jupyter notebook

## Data Preparation and wrangling

Before conducting EDA, it's important to prepare the data, which may include loading data from various sources, handling missing values, and performing data cleaning.

## Data Visualization

Effective data visualization is essential for communicating findings. This repository offers examples of creating various plots and charts using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.
