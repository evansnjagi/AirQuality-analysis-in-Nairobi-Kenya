This a small preview about the data used:
dataset containing measurements of particulate matter (PM),
temperature, and humidity obtained from low-cost sensors. 
Particulate matter refers to tiny particles suspended in the air, 
which can have various sources such as combustion processes, 
industrial activities, and natural sources like dust and pollen.
PM is often categorized based on its size, 
with PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller) 
and PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller) 
being of particular concern due to their potential health effects when inhaled
